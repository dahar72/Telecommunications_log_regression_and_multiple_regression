# Telecommunications_log_regression_and_multiple_regression

Telecommunications company is trying to predict churn within its customers, a logistic regression model is made to show what the causes are and how they can predict which customers will be at risk of churn. The company has also been purchasing customer's income data, and would like a model made that can predict customer's income, preferably using the data that the company has already been accumulating, but based on the data that has been purchased. Both of these models were created successfully.
